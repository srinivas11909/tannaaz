                     <p>
                       Over time, Taannazâ€™s patina finishes may be effaced in places due to the frequency of use.
                       This is not to be considered a defect, but rather a natural process which cannot be avoided,
                       and over time enhances the aged appearance of the metal. Thus, Taannaz cannot guarantee
                       patina finishes of its products and will not repair or replace patina finishes under this
                       warranty.

                       Taannaz has the capacity to provide virtually any custom hardware required for a project. Our
                        design and engineering team can design geometric, organic and classical products through
                        the use of traditional pencil and paper techniques combined with both 2-D and 3-D software
                        packages. All custom designs will incur both design and pattern fees. Design and engineering
                        work is not started until after we have received a deposit. Tooling, fixtures, patterns, and
                        moulds are paid for in full prior to their production. Taannaz retains all ownership rights to
                        custom designs and corresponding moulds, etc., unless otherwise agreed upon in writing.
